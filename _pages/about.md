I am a third-year bioinformatics Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University, with research focused upon natural language processing and generative AI in a biomedical context. I am particularly interested in research topics relevant to precision oncology and drug discovery. Recently, I have worked on both applied projects, for nucleotide and protein language modeling of promoter sequences targeting Glioblastoma subtypes, as well as theoretically-oriented machine learning. 

I received my Bachelor of Science at the University of Chicago, where my research centered about precision oncology and machine learning. My prior studies have also involved extensive context from the mathematical, natural, and data-driven sciences.
